Parents of children and adolescents ages 8-16 years completed measures on their prosocial and antisocial behaviors (i.e., Behavior Assessment Scale for Children, Vineland Adaptive Behaviors Scales, and Child Behavior Checklist) (n = 84; 41 with PAE, 43 without PAE). Seventy-nine participants (40 with PAE, 39 without PAE) also completed a structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan with quality data. Gray matter volumes of seven brain areas supporting social cognitive processes were computed using automated procedures (FreeSurfer 6.0): bilateral fusiform gyrus, superior temporal gyrus, medial orbitofrontal cortex, lateral orbitofrontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, precuneus, and temporal pole. Children and adolescents with PAE showed decreased prosocial behaviors and increased antisocial behaviors as well as smaller volumes of the precuneus and lateral orbitofrontal cortex, even when controlling for total intracranial volume. Social brain volumes were not significantly correlated with prosocial or antisocial behaviors. These findings suggest that children and adolescents with PAE show worse social functioning and smaller volumes of brain areas supporting self-awareness, perspective-taking and emotion-regulation than their same-age peers without PAE.'"

    "**Answer:** We can see in the above cell that the query and the abstract of the paper contains both 'quality' and 'checklist'. What this new method does differently is stemming, as it changes 'controls' to 'control' in the query, and also changes 'controlling' in the abstract to 'control'. This leads to a match, and this is why this method is advantageous over the previous naive tokenization and preprocessing functions. \n"

To do this, first implement a function `idf(t)` to calculate the inverse document frequency, and then use this function to calculate the full tf-idf. Use the _add-one-smoothing_ version of idf, so we don't run into problems with terms that don't appear in the collection at all. The relevant formulas can be found on the lecture slides. Use tf-idf with plain (non-logarithmic) term frequency, as applied by scoring variant `ntn`. Test your function with the examples shown below. You can use the `log10(n)` function to calculate the base 10 logarithm.\n",

This second version should use, as its name suggests, variant `ntc.ntc` instead of `ntn.nnn`, and therefore apply the cosine similarity measure, in addition to applying _tf-idf_. For this, consult the formula for variant `nnc.nnc` on the lecture slides and adopt it to include the _idf_ metric (that is, add the `t` element of `ntc`).
